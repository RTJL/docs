# Learning Golang

## Motivation

- I want to know whats the hype about it
    - Why do so many companies list this language in their JD
    - Whats the pros & cons of the language
    - When is the best scenario to use it
    - What does it excel at & what does it suck at?
- Asked to learn Golang because the organisation is using it
    - Totally not against learning a new language, but as engineers we should know what is good about the laguage such that the entire org is for it.
    - Asked xxx why is the org using it? (background context, current project written in Java)
        - The main answer was Java too verbose. Golang don't need type so much. 
        - Honestly, answer sucks. Shows the lack of depth & understanding of the language, just a superfical answer.
        - IMO its like saying must use list comprehension in Python because it results in fewer lines of code.
        - Whereas someone with (slightly more, just a little bit more) knowledge and understanding of Python might answer;
            - List comprehension should be used because Python has special performance optimisations for it vs a normal for loop
    - As engineers, shouldn't we have deeper understanding into such decisions? Isn't that the bare minimum.

## Gameplan

As suggested by ChatGPT.

Week 1: Basics of syntax, data types, and control flow.
Week 2: Functions, methods, and structuring code.
Week 3: Concurrency basics (e.g., goroutines, channels in Go).
~~Week 4: Build a simple project (e.g., CLI tool, web scraper).~~
~~Weeks 5-6: Explore a framework or library relevant to your interests (e.g., building a REST API).~~
~~Weeks 7-8: Join community discussions, contribute to open-source, and take on more challenging projects.~~
